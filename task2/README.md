ðŸ”’ Security with Dependabot
Dependabot helps us keep our project safe and up to date by automatically checking our dependencies.
For security reasons, we configure Dependabot to:
âœ… Check package dependencies to avoid compatibility issues and outdated libraries.
âœ… Monitor for vulnerabilities: if a package has a known security issue (with a given severity), Dependabot will alert us so we can decide whether an upgrade is required immediately.
âœ… Scan Docker images to detect if they are using base images or packages with high-level vulnerabilities.
âœ… Automate updates by creating pull requests that upgrade dependencies to secure versions.
This ensures that we reduce the risk of introducing insecure or deprecated packages into the project.
